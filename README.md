# AVL-Tree
An AVL Tree created in a school project along with my partner. The DuplicateKeyException was a unique exception that we designed for when the AVL Tree has duplicate nodes.

## Eclipse
This program was created on the IDE Eclipse. To run the program yourself I recommend this IDE or NetBeans for Java.

## Classes in the Program
  ### AVL Tree: 
   The AVLTree class makes use of the implemented BSTNode<K> class down below and
   simulates the functionality of a simple AVL Tree using a Binary Search Tree
   Nodes.
